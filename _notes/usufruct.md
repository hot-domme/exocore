# Usufruct

Usufruct is a legal concept referring to a right in property which confers on the holder the right to use and benefit from the property without altering, damaging, or destroying it. A usufructary does not own the property but does have a legal interest in it which is sanctioned or contractually allowed by the owner. 

A usufructary has two of the three civilian property property interests in the property, *usus* and *fructus*— they do not have the interest of *abusus*, which entitles them to alienate, destroy, consume or sell the property.

## The three civilian property interests:

- **Usus:** The right to use or enjoy a thing posessed, directly and without alteration
- **Fructus:** The right to derive profit from a thing possessed, eg. by lease, cultivation, taxing on entry, etc. *Fructus* (from 'fruit') allows a person to benefit from the sale of renewable commodities of the property.
- **Abusus:** The right to consume, destroy, or transfer the property. This interest is not conferred upon the usufructary. 

## Notes:
- Roman law considered usufruct a type of personal servitude, where the usufructary had no posession of the property. Under a rental agreement today, a person has even more restricted rights over a property than did a usufructary in Rome, but is yet not considered a personal servant.
-  The Law of Modes directed owners of productive property not to harvest the edges of their fields so that the poor may collect the gleanings. This confers a kind of usufructary right by default onto the poor.
-  "Earth belongs – in usufruct – to the living." (Thomas Jefferson).
